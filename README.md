# Objective
In this project, me and my teammates wanted to get an understanding as to which factors affect a country's GDP the most so that we could identify ways for countries to improve their GDP.

# Data Preparation
We had two different datasets, one was from Kaggle that had statistics about countries all over the world and one was data that we webscraped that had information about the size, population and other factors of countires around the world. We then merged these two datasets together in R using vertical integration based on country name.

# Data Analysis
We then performed analysis on our data. We started by looking at the correlation bewteen factors in our dataset and a country's GDP. We used the top four factors to then explore further through scatter plots. We also used a Shapiro-Wilks normality test to analyze the distribution of our data, and from this we determined that our data is not normally distributed. 

# Conclusion
In our findings and conclusions we identified that the factors affecting GDP the most were migration, literacy percentage and technology advancements. Some of the limitations we had were the amount of countries in our different datasets not being the same, only looking at the factors with high positive correlations rather than negative correlations which could have provided some more insight as well, and we only conducted in-depth analysis of four of the features and could have looked at other features as well.
