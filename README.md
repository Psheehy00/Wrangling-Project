# Wrangling-Project

# In this project, me and my teammates wanted to get an understanding as to which factors affect a country's GDP the most so that we could identify ways for countries to improve their GDP. We had two different datasets, one was from Kaggle that had statistics about countries all over the world and one was data that we webscraped that had information about the size, population and other factors of countires around the world. We then merged these two datasets together in R using vertical integration based on country name.

# We then performed analysis on our data. We started by looking at the correlation bewteen factors in our dataset and a country's GDP. We used the top four factors to then explore further through scatter plots. We also used a Shapiro-Wilks normality test to analyze the distribution of our data, and from this we determined that our data is not normally distributed. In our findings and conclusions we identified that the factors affecting GDP the most were migration, literacy percentage and technology advancements.
